# AstroPi Project Code of Conduct

The LionTech's AstroPi project is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of their background or experience. To achieve this goal, we have established the following code of conduct for all participants in the project.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to provide a harassment-free environment for all participants in the AstroPi project, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

We pledge to treat all participants with respect and kindness, and to be welcoming and inclusive to everyone who wants to contribute to the project.

We pledge to not tolerate harassment, bullying, or any other form of abusive behavior towards any participant in the AstroPi project, whether they are a contributor, user, or bystander.

## Our Standards

The following behaviors are expected of all participants in this AstroPi project:

- Be respectful and considerate of others
- Be open to constructive feedback and willing to learn from others
- Use inclusive language that is welcoming to all people, regardless of their background or identity
- Avoid offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments, jokes, or other behavior
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Refrain from engaging in any form of harassment, bullying, or abuse towards any participant in the project
- Respect the privacy and personal information of other participants in the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 - The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
 - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 - Public or private harassment
 - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
 - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

If you believe that someone has violated the AstroPi project code of conduct, please report it to the project maintainers at <project-email@example.com>. All reports will be kept confidential and will be reviewed by the project maintainers as soon as possible.

If a participant is found to have violated the code of conduct, the project maintainers may take action, such as removing the participant's access to the project or other appropriate consequences.

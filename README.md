# AstroPi Project

The AstroPi Project is a scientific project designed to collect data and images using the AstroPi and process the images for scientific purposes. This project is intended to provide a platform for students and researchers to conduct scientific experiments and analyze the resulting data.

## Overview

The AstroPi Project is divided into two main parts: data acquisition and image processing.

The data acquisition part of the project collects data from the AstroPi's sensors and saves it to a file. The main entry point for this part of the project is `code/data_acquisition/main.py`, which initializes the sensors, starts data collection, and saves the data to a file.

The image processing part of the project processes the images collected by the AstroPi. The main entry point for this part of the project is `code/image_processing/process_image.py`, which contains the main logic for processing images collected by the AstroPi.

The project also includes documentation, hardware schematics, and 3D models of the AstroPi case and mounting hardware.
